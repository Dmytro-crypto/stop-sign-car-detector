# stop-sign-car-detector
it will detect if there any stopsigns or cars, and will tell if driving is alloweds

My name is Dmytro Nekrash i am 14 years old and this is my first project made using Python in app PyCharm

This is Ai and it will detect if there is any stop signs/cars in the way and tell if the driving is allowed. If you want to expand this you can make i actually usefull in real life example because,
this can be used in apps like google maps and it will tell when to keep moving and when to stop moving. This feature can help make better technology like autodriving for the cars etc.
